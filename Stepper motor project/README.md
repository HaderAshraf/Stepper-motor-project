<h1>:point_right: Project idea </h1>
<h4>The main idea of this project is that we control the stepper motor speed through three switches. First one to stop the stepper motor, Second one to activate the half-speed mode, and the third one to activate the full-speed mode. Also, the current mode of stepper motor will be displayed on the seven-segment.</h4>

<h1>:point_right:8086 Microprocessor </h1>
<h4>Intel 8086 is a 16-bit processor designed by Intel. It is a processor that handles a 16-bit word at a time. The data is stored inside the processor in the registers and the different addresses are stored in it. We use it to control the speed of stepper motor</h4>
